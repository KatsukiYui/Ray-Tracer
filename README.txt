Things I have added to the raytracer:

	- Multithreading - Main
	- RayTriangle Intersections - Tracer Class
	- OBJ Loader - Mesh Class
	- Anti-Aliasing - Main + Tracer Class

Please only choose option 1 in the menu as the rest arent multithreaded.

Depending on the version of VS you might need to copy the SDL2.dll
